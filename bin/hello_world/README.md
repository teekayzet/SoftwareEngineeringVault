# Overview

This software is a simple Java application that greets the user based on their country of origin. It uses a pre-defined map of greetings for different countries and prompts the user to enter their name and country. The application then retrieves the appropriate greeting from the map based on the user's country and displays a personalized greeting.

The purpose of creating this software is to improve my skills as a software engineer by working on a small, practical project. It allows me to practice Java programming, data structures (using a map), user input handling, and flow control.
