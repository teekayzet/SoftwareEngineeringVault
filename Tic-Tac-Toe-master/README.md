## Overview

I've recently designed and developed a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. My goal is to showcase my proficiency in Java programming and further my learning as a software engineer. The software demonstrates my understanding of Java syntax, object-oriented principles, and GUI development using Swing.

The purpose behind creating this software is to sharpen my skills in Java, particularly focusing on event-driven programming, graphical user interface design, and application of object-oriented concepts in a practical project.

## Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used the following tools and technologies:
- IDE: I utilized IntelliJ IDEA as my primary integrated development environment for writing, debugging, and testing the Java code.
- Graphics Library: Java's Swing library was extensively used to design and implement the graphical user interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Programming Language: The entire project was implemented in Java, making use of its core functionalities and libraries for user interface development.

## Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites particularly helpful in understanding Java Swing, event handling, and Best Practices:
- Oracle's Java Swing Tutorials - This resource provided detailed explanations and examples of Swing components and GUI design principles, aiding in the development of the user interface.
- GeeksforGeeks - I came across a helpful tutorial on developing a simple Hangman game using Java Swing. Although different from Tic-Tac-Toe, the principles of event handling and GUI development proved to be transferable.

## Future Work

In future iterations of the project, I plan to incorporate and address the following:
- Implementing an intelligent computer opponent using AI algorithms like the Minimax algorithm to provide a challenging single-player mode.
- Enhancing the user interface with animations and sound effects to make the game more engaging and visually appealing.
- Adding a win/loss counter and a reset button for tracking scores and easily starting new games without relaunching the application.
