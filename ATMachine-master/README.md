## Overview

This Java ATM Banking System is a simple application that allows users to perform basic banking transactions, such as withdrawing and depositing cash, checking their balance, and transferring money. The system is designed to be easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users.

The system uses a database to store user accounts and transaction information. It also uses a variety of security features to protect user data and prevent fraudulent transactions.

## Development Environment

The system was developed using the following tools:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11
* IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (IDE)
* Git and GitHub for version control

## Useful Websites

During the development of the system, I found the following websites helpful:

* Oracle Java Documentation - Official documentation for Java, providing detailed explanations and examples of Java features and APIs.
* Stack Overflow - A popular question and answer website for programming-related topics. It offers a vast range of answers to common programming questions and issues.
* Baeldung - A comprehensive blog with tutorials covering various Java topics, including code examples and best practices.
* YouTube - Java tutorials (by Telusko) - A YouTube playlist with Java tutorials by Telusko, providing step-by-step explanations and demonstrations of Java concepts.

## Purpose

The purpose of developing this system was to improve my skills as a software engineer by working on a medium-sized, practical project. It allowed me to practice Java programming, database management, security features, and user interface design.

I also hope that this system can be useful to others who are learning Java programming or who need a simple ATM banking system for their own personal or business use.
